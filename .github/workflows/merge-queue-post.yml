    # The only way to set different required status checks to a pre-queue and a post-queue ,
    # (i.e. before merging and in merge queue), is to have two jobs with the same name, one that triggers on pull_request,
    # and another on merge_group.
    # The 'Ready for mergequeue' which is triggered on pull_request (unicorn.yml) is a required status to be able to merge
    # The 'Ready for mergequeue' triggered on merge_group here will block merging untill it has completed with success.
